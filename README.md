## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was very helpful to learn more about form validation in the client-side. I chose to not use the constraint validation API and built my on validation. That taught me a lot about how the components works and how to interact with them using JavaScript to get the data that was provided after clicking to submit.

Also, I could learn a lot about how Regular Expressions works and how to implement them to validate data.

### Continued development

I want to use more the constraint validation API and learn more about the form validation methods whether in client-side or server-side.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me a lot to understand how the server-side validation can be done.
- [RegEx Library](https://uibakery.io/regex-library?ref=producthunt) - This provided to me useful RegEx resources and taught me how to implement it.
